This means you can assign a Floating IP to a Server in one Location and later reassign it to a Server in a different Location. For optimal routing and latency Floating IPs should be used in the Location they were created in.\n\nFor Floating IPs to work with your Server, you must configure them inside your operation system.\n\nFloating IPs of type `ipv4` use a single IPv4 address as their `ip` property. Floating IPs of type `ipv6` use a /64 network such as `fc00::/64` as their `ip` property.

      "description": "Networks is a private networks feature. These Networks are optional and they coexist with the public network that every Server has by default.\n\nThey allow Servers to talk to each other over a dedicated network interface using private IP addresses not available publicly.\n\nThe IP addresses are allocated and managed via the API, they must conform to [RFC1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918#section-3) standard. IPs and network interfaces defined under Networks do not provide public internet connectivity, you will need to use the already existing public network interface for that.\n\nEach network has a user selected `ip_range` which defines all available IP addresses which can be used for Subnets within the Network.\n\nTo assign individual IPs to Servers you will need to create Network Subnets, described below.\n\nCurrently Networks support IPv4 only.\n\n### Subnets\nSubnets divide the `ip_range` from the parent Network object into multiple Subnetworks that you can use for different specific purposes.\n\nFor each subnet you need to specify its own `ip_range` which must be contained within the parent Network’s `ip_range`. Additionally each subnet must belong to one of the available Network Zones described below. Subnets can not have overlapping IP ranges.\n\nCurrently there are three types of subnet:\n* type `cloud` is used to connect cloud Resources into your Network.\n* type `server` was used to connect only cloud Servers into your Network. This type is deprecated and is replaced by type cloud.\n* type `vswitch` allows you to connect [Dedicated Server vSwitch](https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/dedicated-server/network/vswitch) - and all Dedicated Servers attached to it - into your Network\n\nSubnets of type `vswitch` must set a `vswitch_id` which is the ID of the existing vSwitch in Hetzner Robot that should be coupled.\n\n### Network Zones\nNetwork Zones are groups of Locations which have special high-speed network connections between them. The [Location object](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/#locations-get-a-location) contains the `network_zone` property each Location belongs to. Currently these network zones exist:\n\n|Network Zone|Contains Locations|\n|------------|------------------|\n|eu-central  | nbg1, fsn1, hel1 |\n|us-east     | ash              |\n|us-west     | hil              |\n|ap-southeast| sin              |\n\n### IP address management\nWhen a cloud Server is attached to a network without the user specifying an IP it automatically gets an IP address assigned from a subnet of type `server` in the same network zone. If you specify the optional `ip` parameter when attaching then we will try to assign that IP. Keep in mind that the Server’s location must be covered by the Subnet’s Network Zone if you specify an IP, or that at least one Subnet with the zone covering Server’s location must exist.\n\nA cloud Server can also have more than one IP address in a Network by specifying aliases. For details see the [attach to network action](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/#server-actions-attach-a-server-to-a-network).\n\nThe following IP addresses are reserved in networks and can not be used:\n  * the first IP of the network `ip_range` as it will be used as a default gateway for the private Network interface.\n  * `172.31.1.1` as it is being used as default gateway for our public Network interfaces.\n\n### Coupling Dedicated Servers\n\nBy using subnets of type `vswitch` you can couple the Cloud Networks with an existing [Dedicated Server vSwitch](https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/dedicated-server/network/vswitch) and enable dedicated and cloud servers to\ntalk to each other over the Network.\nIn order for this to work the dedicated servers may only use IPs from the subnet and must have a special network configuration. Please refer to [FAQ](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/networks/connect-dedi-vswitch). vSwitch Layer 2 features are not supported.\n\n### Routes\nNetworks also support the notion of routes which are automatically applied to private traffic. A route makes sure that all packets for a given `destination` IP prefix will be sent to the address specified in its `gateway`.\n"

The distribution of the different instances within a group is based on a pattern specified in the type.

This decreases the probability that some instances might fail together.\n"

You can also add more Subnets later by using the [add subnet action](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/#network-actions-add-a-subnet-to-a-network). If you do not specify an `ip_range` in the subnet we will automatically pick the first available /24 range for you.\n\nYou may specify one or more routes in `routes`. You can also add more routes later by using the [add route action](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/#network-actions-add-a-route-to-a-network).\n",

This is the recommended way. You can be even more specific by setting `datacenter` to the ID or name as listed in `/datacenters`. However we only recommend this if you want to assign a specific Primary IP to the Server which is located in the specified Datacenter.\n\nSome properties like `start_after_create` or `automount` will trigger Actions after the Server is created. Those Actions are listed in the `next_actions` field in the response.\n\nFor accessing your Server we strongly recommend to use SSH keys by passing the respective key IDs in `ssh_keys`. If you do not specify any `ssh_keys` we will generate a root password for you and return it in the response.\n\nPlease note that provided user-data is stored in our systems. While we take measures to protect it we highly recommend that you don’t use it to store passwords or other sensitive information.\n\n#### Call specific error codes\n\n| Code                             | Description                                                |\n|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `placement_error`                | An error during the placement occurred                     |\n| `primary_ip_assigned`            | The specified Primary IP is already assigned to a server   |\n| `primary_ip_datacenter_mismatch` | The specified Primary IP is in a different datacenter      |\n| `primary_ip_version_mismatch`    | The specified Primary IP has the wrong IP Version          |\n"
